# Instructions for Creating and Fulfilling Pull Requests Based on `.github/.task.md` and `.github/.pr.md`

Make use of the `git` and `gh` applications where appropriate.

1. **Create a New Branch:**

   - Based on the type of request (feature/_, bugfix/_, chore/\*, etc.) and the task at hand, create a new branch with an appropriate name.

2. **Read the `.github/.task.md` File:**

   - Open and carefully read the entire `.task.md` document.
   - Understand the overall goal and specific tasks to be accomplished.

3. **Read the `.github/.pr.md` File:**

   - Open `.github/.pr.md` and carefully read the entire document.
   - Understand the **Description** section to grasp the purpose of the pull request (PR).
   - Pay attention to the goals, background, and design decisions outlined in the description.

4. **Modify Files as Needed:**

   - Based on the tasks listed in the **Tasks** section of `.github/.pr.md`, locate and modify the relevant files in the current directory to meet the PR requirements.
   - Ensure all requested changes, updates, or additions are applied according to the tasks outlined in the PR.

5. **Create and Update Tests:**

   - Tests must always be created or updated for any code changes.
   - Ensure all necessary tests are implemented as specified in the **Tasks** section.
   - If no tests are listed in the tasks, add an entry for creating/updating tests.

6. **Commit Changes:**

   - After every successful or unsuccessful test run, commit the code to the branch.
   - Use descriptive commit messages that explain the purpose of each change.

7. **Track Progress Using the Task List:**

   - As you work through each task listed under the **Tasks** section, update `.github/.pr.md` to reflect your progress:
     - Add checkboxes to the list for each completed task, using `- [x]` for completed tasks and `- [ ]` for tasks yet to be done.
     - Modify the task list as needed if new tasks arise during implementation.

8. **Testing and Validation:**

   - Run all tests to verify that the changes are functioning correctly.
   - Document any test results or issues encountered.

9. **Visual Confirmation (If Applicable):**

   - If the **Screenshots** section is present, add visual confirmation (screenshots, GIFs, etc.) of any UI changes.
   - If there are no visual changes, leave this section as is or remove it if irrelevant.

10. **Handling Related Issues:**

    - If the PR references specific issues (under **Related Issues**), make sure the changes properly address the issue(s) mentioned.
    - Use the `Fixes #` or `Closes #` notation to reference the appropriate issue(s) that will be resolved by the PR.

11. **Notes for Reviewers:**

    - Review the **Notes for Reviewers** section for any specific instructions or concerns the PR author has raised.
    - If you encounter any additional details or areas of concern while working on the PR, document them in this section.

12. **Final Update to `.github/.pr.md`:**

    - Once all tasks are completed and changes have been made, review `.github/.pr.md` one last time.
    - Make sure all tasks are properly checked off, any relevant notes have been added, and that the PR is ready for review.

13. **Create Pull Request:**

    - Use the content in `.github/.pr.md` to create a pull request from the current branch into the `main` branch.
    - Ensure all sections from the template are properly filled out with the information from your work.

14. **Clean Up:**

    - Before the final push, delete `.github/.task.md`, `.github/.pr.md`, and any `.github/.instruct.*.md` files from the branch, and commit the changes.

15. **Final Push:**
    - Push the final version of the branch with all changes and the cleaned-up file structure.

By following these instructions, you'll be able to create a new branch, implement the required changes, create and update tests, track progress, create a pull request, and clean up the branch efficiently while ensuring clear communication and accurate tracking of progress through the entire process.
