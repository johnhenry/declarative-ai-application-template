# Instructions for Creating a Draft Pull Request

1. Read the contents of the `.github/.task.md` file.

2. Open and analyze the pull request template located at `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

3. Fill out the template with information from the task file:

   a. In the description section, include the overall goal from the task.

   b. Create a list of tasks to accomplish the goal, based on the information in the task file.

   c. Complete any other sections present in the template using relevant information from the task file.

4. If there are sections in the template that cannot be filled with information from the task file, leave placeholders or notes for manual completion.

5. Ensure that the formatting and structure of the pull request description match the template.

6. Review the draft for consistency and completeness.

7. If any information is missing or unclear, add a comment or placeholder in the appropriate section to highlight areas that may need human review or additional input.

8. Prepare the draft pull request with the completed description.

Remember to maintain the original structure and any specific formatting requirements of the pull request template while incorporating the task information.
